Case A

The first function can be computed by the simple formula

A(x) = x2

The function can also be computed recursively:

A(0) = 0

A(1) = 1

A(2) = 4

A(n) = 3·A(n-1) - 3·A(n-2) + A(n-3)   if n >= 3

Case B

The second function can be computed by the formula

B(x) = n2·2n + n·3n

The function can also be computed recursively

B(0) = 0

B(1) = 5

B(2) = 34

B(3) = 153

B(4) = 2015

B(n) = 12·B(n-1) - 57·B(n-2) + 134·B(n-3) - 156·B(n-4) + 72·B(n-5)   if n >= 5

Case C

The third function can be computed by the formula

C(x) = 12 + 8·n - 3·n2 + n3

The function can also be computed recursively

C(0) = 12

C(1) = 18

C(n) = 2·C(n-1) - C(n-2) for n >= 2
